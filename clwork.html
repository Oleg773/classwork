    <dfn> After the end of TI5, a new CIS Rejects team appeared on the Dota stage. It consisted of CIS players who
        failed to sign contracts with organizations for the new season. The team has managed to achieve some success by
        winning a number of small online tournaments. In November, the lineup changed a lot: Goblak joins the team, and
        a young RAMZES666 player takes Kerry's position. Updated CIS Rejects get stronger and qualify for the first
        major tournament - StarlLadder.</dfn>
    <dfn> On December 6, 2015, the new organization Team Spirit signs the mix. The team was known for its good
        performance in the qualifiers for major events, but in Lana the guys did not manage to take high places. Their
        best achievement can be called a hit at The Shanghai Major 2016, but in the tournament itself, the guys took
        13-16 place. After failing in the open qualifiers for TI6, in August 2016 the team ceased to exist.</dfn>
